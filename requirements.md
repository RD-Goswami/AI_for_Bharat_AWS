# Requirements Document: Prachar.ai - The AI Creative Director

## Project Overview

**Prachar.ai** is an autonomous AI Creative Director designed for Indian students, creators, and college clubs competing in the AWS "AI for Bharat" Hackathon (Student Track: Media, Content & Creativity). The system uses agentic AI to autonomously plan, draft, and design culturally relevant social media campaigns in Hinglish, leveraging AWS Bedrock for reasoning and generation, with RAG-based brand consistency.

### Development Methodology

This project follows **Kiro's Spec-Driven Development** methodology:

1. **Requirements First**: Comprehensive functional and non-functional requirements with testable acceptance criteria
2. **Design Specification**: Detailed system architecture, component design, and API specifications
3. **Iterative Implementation**: Code developed against specifications with continuous validation
4. **Test-Driven Validation**: Unit, integration, and property-based tests aligned with acceptance criteria
5. **Documentation-Centric**: All decisions, trade-offs, and implementations documented for transparency

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Autonomous Campaign Planning

**User Story:** As a student club organizer, I want to provide a high-level goal and have the AI autonomously create a complete campaign plan, so I don't need to manually specify every detail.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user submits a Campaign_Goal, THE Creative_Director_Agent SHALL analyze the goal and generate a structured Campaign_Plan
2. WHEN planning, THE Creative_Director_Agent SHALL use Bedrock_Claude to reason about the target audience and cultural context
3. WHEN the plan is created, THE Creative_Director_Agent SHALL include at least 3 components: hook, offer, and call-to-action
4. WHEN planning completes, THE Creative_Director_Agent SHALL autonomously proceed to content generation without user intervention
5. WHEN the agent encounters ambiguity, THE Creative_Director_Agent SHALL make reasonable assumptions based on Indian student context

### Requirement 2: Brand-Aware Content Generation

**User Story:** As a creator with a specific brand voice, I want the AI to read my brand guidelines before generating content, so all outputs match my established style.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN generating any content, THE Creative_Director_Agent SHALL first retrieve Brand_Style_Guidelines from the Brand_Knowledge_Base
2. WHEN brand guidelines exist, THE Creative_Director_Agent SHALL incorporate tone, voice, and style preferences into generation prompts
3. WHEN no brand guidelines are found, THE Creative_Director_Agent SHALL use default Indian youth-friendly tone
4. WHEN retrieving guidelines, THE system SHALL use Bedrock Knowledge Base RAG with semantic search
5. WHEN brand context is retrieved, THE Creative_Director_Agent SHALL log the retrieved chunks for transparency

### Requirement 3: Hinglish Copywriting

**User Story:** As an Indian student marketer, I want campaign copy in Hinglish that resonates with my peers, so my content feels authentic and culturally relevant.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN generating text content, THE Creative_Director_Agent SHALL use Bedrock_Claude to produce Hinglish copy
2. WHEN writing copy, THE system SHALL mix Hindi and English words naturally (40-60% Hindi, 60-40% English)
3. WHEN generating copy, THE system SHALL include culturally appropriate emojis and slang
4. WHEN the Campaign_Goal mentions festivals or events, THE system SHALL incorporate relevant cultural references
5. WHEN copy is generated, THE system SHALL produce exactly 3 caption variations for user selection

### Requirement 4: Autonomous Visual Generation

**User Story:** As a busy student, I want the AI to automatically create campaign posters that match my brand colors, so I don't need design skills.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the Campaign_Plan includes visual requirements, THE Creative_Director_Agent SHALL autonomously call the image generation tool
2. WHEN generating images, THE system SHALL use Bedrock_Titan Image Generator v1
3. WHEN brand colors are specified in Brand_Style_Guidelines, THE system SHALL enforce those colors in the image prompt
4. WHEN generating posters, THE system SHALL include the campaign hook text as overlay
5. WHEN image generation completes, THE system SHALL return a publicly accessible S3 URL

### Requirement 5: Responsible AI with Guardrails

**User Story:** As a platform administrator, I want all generated content to be filtered for hate speech and PII, so we maintain a safe and compliant platform.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN generating any text content, THE system SHALL apply Bedrock_Guardrails before returning output
2. WHEN guardrails detect policy violations, THE system SHALL block the output and regenerate with safer prompts
3. WHEN PII is detected, THE system SHALL redact or reject the content
